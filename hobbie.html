                    <h1>Study</h1>
                    <p>One of the things I like to do the most is to learn And
                        I am currently in grade 11, In addition to that I am studying
                        programming at the Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira and last
                        but not least I have two courses in udemy in which day by day 
                        I am learning from them, The person that you can see in the image
                        is one of the Python teachers his name is Nicolás Schurmann and he
                        is one of my inspirations</p>

                    <h1>Program</h1>
                    <p>Another thing that I like to do is programming challenges,
                        because by challenging myself to do these kinds of challenges,
                        I learn too much when reaching a solution.</p>

                    <h1>Play</h1>
                    <p>After studying and spending a few hours programming,
                        it's good to de-stress for a while while playing and
                        that's what I do. I usually play a lot with my friends
                        and it's a lot of fun.</p>

                    <h1>Draw</h1>
                    <p>A Hobbit that I like to do a lot but I have been leaving it is
                        to draw, I love to make drawings by hand and paint them, but for
                        the future I want to dedicate myself to making them digitally.</p>
